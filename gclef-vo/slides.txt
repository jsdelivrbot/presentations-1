# Virtual Observatory in a nutshell

## IVOA
>- The International Virtual Observatory Alliance defines standards for interoperability among
astronomy services, archives, and applications.

## A Use Case
- Build a Knowledge Base without VO:
	1. Go to a specific archive's webpage
	2. Make a query
	3. Download data
	4. GoTo 1 for each archive in your list
	5. Discover new knowledge and publish papers
	6. ~~Publish derived data products in custom service~~

- Build a Knowledge Base with VO:
    1. Open your favorite VO application 
    2. Make queries against all compliant services
    3. Download data in your Knowledge Base
    4. Discover new knowledge and publish papers
    5. Publish derived data products in a VO service

## With VO
>- services can implement standard data discovery and retrieval protocols
- clients implementing the same protocols serve as a single point of entry for users

## VO Standards
- VOTable
- Data Models (e.g. Spectrum, Cube, SpaceTime Coordinates)
- Data Access Protocols (e.g. Table, Spectral, Image Access Protocol, Cone Search)
- Simple Application Messaging Protocol
- ...

## VOTable
> - an XML schema representing tables:
	- structured header (PARAMs, FIELDs, GROUPs)
	- rows and columns (different serializations)
    - can wrap FITS files.

. . .

> - Semantics provided by:
    - UCD Unified Content Descriptors (a vocabulary)
    	- e.g. stat.error;phot.mag;em.opt.V
   	- UTYPE: pointer into a data model definition

## Data Models (pre-VODML)
- UTYPEs (pointers):
	- did not have a proper standard
- Models, i.e. the target of the pointing:
    - Human readable
    - Defined custom serializations
    - XML schemata defined but unused:
		- clashed with the more common tabular representation

. . .

Mismatch between the tabular representation astronomers are used to
and the structured nature of a data model.

# VODML in a nutshell

## VO Data Modeling Language
- A set of standardized languages for:
    - describing data models (a safe subset of UML class diagrams):
        - extensible
        - machine readable
        - easily implementable on client/server side
        - interoperable (unlike XMI)
        - defines IDs for Data Model elements.
    - mapping meta-models:
        - e.g. VODML $\Leftrightarrow$ VOTable 
        - decouples Model from Serialization
        - uses Data Model element pointers (UTYPEs)

##
- VODML bridges the mismatch between:
	- the tabular representation of astronomical data (usually completely de-normalized)
	- the Object model underlying the astronomical domain.

## Applications of VODML
- consolidation of I/O libraries into interoperable modules
	- models and their representations are separate
- interoperability of Data Models
    - e.g. find a position (Space Time Coordinate) in an unknown container (e.g. a Source in a Catalog)
	- Data Cubes, Images, Spectra, Time Series

## Future applications
- data integration in astronomy (Global as View)
	- query against a global data model
    - mediate query from global to local model
    - query against the local data model
    - integrate result set according to the global data model
