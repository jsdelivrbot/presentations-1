# Virtual Observatory in a nutshell

## IVOA
>- The International Virtual Observatory Alliance defines standards for interoperability between astronomy services/archives.

## A Use Case
- Build a Knowledge Base without VO:
	1. Go to the specific mission's webpage
	2. Make a query against the mission's archive
	3. Download data
	4. GoTo 1 For Each Mission 
	5. Discover new knowledge and publish papers
	6. ~~Publish derived data products in custom service~~

- Build a Knowledge Base with VO:
    1. Go to your favorite VO enabled application 
    2. Make a query against any compliant services
    3. Download data in your Knowledge Base
    4. Discover new knowledge and publish papers
    5. Publish derived data products in VO service

## With VO
- services can implement standard query and retrieval protocols
- clients implementing the same protocols represent a single point of entry for users

## VO Standards
- VOTable
- Data Models (e.g. Spectrum, Cube, SpaceTime Coordinates)
- Data Access Protocols (e.g. Table Access Protocol, Spectral Access, Image Access)
- Simple Application Messaging Protocol

## VOTable
- an XML schema representing tables (header + rows and columns)
- can wrap FITS files.
- Semantics provided by:
    - UCD Unified Content Descriptors (a vocabulary)
    	- e.g. stat.error;phot.mag;em.opt.V
   	- UTYPE: pointer into a data model definition

- UTYPEs:
	- did not have a proper standard

## Data Models (before)
- description, i.e. the target of the pointing:
    - Human readable
    - Custom serialization
    - XSDs defined but unused as they clashed with the more common tabular representation.

. . .

Mismatch between the tabular representation of data astronomers are used to
and the structured semantics of the underlying domain of discourse.
