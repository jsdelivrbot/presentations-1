# Future
- Iris developed at SAO on limited resources:
    - Specview4Iris cannot be maintained
    - Does not support high resolution spectra
    - Looking for a new visualizer
- Much of the functionality available on Python, but:
    - VO compatibility layer is Java
- Support new models:
    - Spectral DM 2.0
    - Cube DM
