## VODML
- Normative part is basically unchanged since Heidelberg:
    - `utype` -> `vodml-ref`
- Informative sections already improved before Banff.
- Nothing major changed since Banff.
    - Few minor *To Be Discussed* addressed.
- Implementation feedback is good: only one issue identified (while working on STC2).
- [Working on more XMI translation scripts.]

. . .

Document seems stable. Should be ready for Proposed Recommendation
pending few TBDs at this meeting.

## To Be Discussed
>- Few TBDs left in the document:
    - prefix: globally unique or defined in serialization?
    - SKOSConcept/RDF/Enumeration
	- subsets issues from implementation feedback
- One TODO:
    - reformat a figure 

## Mapping Document
>- Semantics basically unchanged since Heidelberg:
    - Syntax now has `VODML` element i.s.o. `utype` attribute, pending VOTable decision
    - Updated *reference* VOTable serialization with new syntax
- Added support for Object Relational Mapping
- Work in progress (with Apps WG)
